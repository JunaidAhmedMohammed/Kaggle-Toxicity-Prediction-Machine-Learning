# Kaggle-Toxicity-Prediction-Machine-Learning
An exciting challenge is creating a model that can accurately predict which chemicals are toxic using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and data analysis techniques. With the rapid pace of chemical synthesis in the modern world, traditional toxicity testing methods are becoming increasingly impractical. However, thanks to the power of in-silico techniques, we now have the potential to significantly reduce the time, cost, and animal testing involved in detecting toxicity.
